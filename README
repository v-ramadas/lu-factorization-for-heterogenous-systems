To compile and run, please use one of the Slurm scripts mentioned below
1)	luFactorization.sh (To run scaling analysis for all implementations over different dataset sizes)
2)	threadOptimization.sh (To run all implementations for a matrix of length 1024 over different OpenMP thread counts)
3)	blockWidthOptimization.sh (To run column block implementation for a matrix of size 1024, 25 threads over a range of block widths)
4)	streamOptimization.sh (To run all implementations for a matrix of length 1024, 25 threads over a range of CUDA stream counts)

The binary in each case is "./luFactorization"
